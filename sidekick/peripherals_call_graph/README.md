# Peripheral Call Graphs

This script will create call graph for the selected memory section (you can select between graph containing all functions or only paths that lead to functions that do have been renamed). It can be useful when you want to trace use of peripherals to some known functionality. The script will print any functions with non-standard name that are encountered during the traverse to the output window.
